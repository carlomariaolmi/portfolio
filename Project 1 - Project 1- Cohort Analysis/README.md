### Cohort analysis with Python
A cohort is a group of users who share something in common, be it their sign-up date, first purchase month, birth date, acquisition channel, etc. Cohort analysis is the method by which these groups are tracked over time, helping you spot trends, understand repeat behaviours (purchases, engagement, amount spent, etc.), and monitor your customer and revenue retention.

### Why is it valuable?
Cohort analysis can be helpful when it comes to understanding your business’ health and “stickiness” — the loyalty of your customers. Stickiness is critical since it’s far cheaper and easier to keep a current customer than to acquire a new one. For startups, it’s also a key indicator of product-market fit.

Additionally, your product evolves over time. New features are added and removed, the design changes, etc. Observing individual groups over time is a starting point to understanding how these changes affect user behaviour.

It’s also a good way to visualise your user retention/churn as well as formulating a basic understanding of their lifetime value.
